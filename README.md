#npm run built the application . 
Follow the given steps.
Step-1: (Avoid this step if you have cloned your repository from GitHub)

Create the React application: npx create-react-app app-name
Navigate to the project application: cd app-name
Initialize your application: git init
Add it as remote: git remote add origin your_github_repository_url.git

Step-2:

Clone your repository: git clone your_github_repository_url
Navigate to project application: cd app-name
Install dependencies: npm install
Start your application to check: npm start
Install a packagegh-pagesas a dev-dependency of the application

cd app-name
npm install gh-pages --save-dev


Step 3:-
Add homepage property to package.json file.
Open your package.json file and add the below homepage.

"homepage": "http://{abhishekpoddar29}.github.io/{https://github.com/abhishekpoddar29/Educational-initiative-assignment}"


Step-4:

In the existing scripts property, add the property predeploy and deploy

"scripts": {
//...
"predeploy": "npm run build",
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
#Install react-icon:-
yarn add react-icons
 or
npm install react-icons --save





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
